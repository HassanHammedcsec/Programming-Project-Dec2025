# Programming-Project-Dec2025
My first Programming project for QQI Level 5. Using JAVA, I created a system to collect data from a fruit farm employee and printed out a payslip for the employee.
I used print statements in this program (printf, println and print).
I used the IF statement in this program.
I used formart tools.
